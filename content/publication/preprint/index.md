abstract: We study the effects of high-intensity rains (HIR) on the day of birth on newborn health in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. We merge geodata from rainfall stations with administrative birth certificate records, creating a uniquely rich dataset covering the universe of births and HIR in Rio de Janeiro from 2006-2019. We find that: 1) HIRs increase the likelihood of "low" and "very low" Apgar scores at the 5-minute mark by, at most, 29% and 40%, respectively; 2) the negative impact of HIR on Apgar scores is concentrated in health units affiliated with the SUS (Unified Health System), and 3) these adverse health effects are concentrated in units close to flood points.
